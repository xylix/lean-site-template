      <description>On Friday 25.9.2020, EA Helsinki participated in HYY&amp;rsquo;s Fresher Challenge. In the Fresher Challenge freshmen get to know the various student organizations by completing fun challenges as a team.
Thanks to all the freshmen who completed our checkpoint! They we&amp;rsquo;re all nice and energetic, and approached our checkpoint thoughtfully.
Our checkpoint consisted of a quiz, where correct answers earned the team money that they then got to give away at the end of the checkpoint.</description>

Effective altruists aim to consider all causes and actions, and then act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact. It is this broad evidence-based approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity.

      <description>Reading Material 
A lot of material has been developed on how we can go about doing a lot of good. Here is some of the best.
If you like TED talks, watch Peter Singer’s The Why and How of Effective Altruism or check out any of the other TED talks and presentations on effective altruism. The Life You Can Save (Singer’s first book on Effective Altruism) in 3 minutes is also a great watch.</description>
